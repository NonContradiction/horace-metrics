# horace-metrics
This is an R analysis in bar charts of the different poetic schemas used by the Latin poet Horace

The textual authority followed was that of Daniel H. Garrison, editor for the Oklahoma Series in Classical Culture volume of Horace's Odes & Epodes (and the Carmen Saeculare).

The RShiny app was launched from a local directory containing the ui.R and server.R files, and a sub-directory entitles "data" containing the odes.csv data file.

The final product may be viewed here: https://noncontradiction.shinyapps.io/horace/
